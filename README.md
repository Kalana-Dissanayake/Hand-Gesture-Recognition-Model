Hand Gesture Recognition Model
Utilized OpenCV to capture images of various hand gestures through a webcam.
Preprocessed regions of interest (ROI) by converting to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, and thresholding to isolate the hand.
Designed a CNN with layers including Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
